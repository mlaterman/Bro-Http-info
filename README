http-info.bro

Bro script to gather extra data about http connections.

Original version written by Phillipa Gill (2008)

Updated version includes a new record type for logging 

http-info.bro

New version of script that only collects data not present in bro's default http.log and puts it into a new output log
A table based on conn$uid is used to track connections - as multiple req+res pairs can use the same conn it is possible for the httpinfo.log file to have less entries than the http.log file

added module functionality to v2

http-info2.bro attempts to add the extended information to http.log by extending the HTTP::Info records
Additional information is logged directly to the http.log file
